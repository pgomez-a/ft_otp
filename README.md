### One-Time-Passwords
A One Time Password (OTP) is an automatically generated sequence of numeric or alphanumeric characters to authenticate users for a single sign-on. An OTP is a multi-factor authentication factor used to guarantee access to private data. The main characteristics of an OTP are the following:
- It expires quickly.
- It can't be reused.

One-time passwords are generated using a random code that is generated each time a new password request is made. There are three different ways that allow a user to obtain their OTP:
- An authentication token.
- A unique time-based password, also known as TOTP.
- A unique password based on HMAC, also known as HOTP.
